                        <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by
                            cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
                            Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a
                            distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature
                            of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority,
                            rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.</p>

                        <h3 class="loi2">Bitcoin</h3>
                        <p>Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks;
                            managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by
                            the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls
                            Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin
                            allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="loi2">What's a bitcoin wallet?</h3>
                        <p>A Bitcoin wallet is a software program in which Bitcoins are stored. Technically,
                            Bitcoins are not stored anywhere. For every individual who has a balance in a
                            Bitcoin wallet, there is a private key (secret number) corresponding to the
                            Bitcoin address of that wallet. Bitcoin wallets facilitate the sending and
                            receiving of Bitcoins and give ownership of the Bitcoin balance to the user.
                            The Bitcoin wallet comes in many forms. The four main types are desktop,
                            mobile, web, and hardware.

                    <p>Plastic grocery-type bags that get thrown out end up in landfills or in other
                        parts of the environment. These can suffocate animals who get stuck in them
                        or may mistake them for food. Also, it takes a while for the bags to decompose.

                <h2>Invest in crypto now!</h2>
                <p>Bitcoin has recently reached the price of $25,000 AUD. Invest in crypto before it's too
                    late! With cryptocurrencies, your money is yours only and stays yours forever. You do
                    not rely on financial institutions for holding or transferring it. You do not have to
                    pay their exorbitant fees. In the long run, it can become the basis of a truly open
                    and decentralized economy.
