                    <h1 class="loi1"><br>What's crypto?</h1>
                    <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by
                        cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
                        Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a
                        distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature
                        of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority,
                        rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.</p>

                    <h3 class="loi2">Bitcoin</h3>
                    <p>Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks;
                        managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by
                        the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls
                        Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin
                        allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="loi2">What's a bitcoin wallet?</h3>
                    <p>A Bitcoin wallet is a software program in which Bitcoins are stored. Technically,
                        Bitcoins are not stored anywhere. For every individual who has a balance in a
                        Bitcoin wallet, there is a private key (secret number) corresponding to the
                        Bitcoin address of that wallet. Bitcoin wallets facilitate the sending and
                        receiving of Bitcoins and give ownership of the Bitcoin balance to the user.
                        The Bitcoin wallet comes in many forms. The four main types are desktop,
                        mobile, web, and hardware.

                <h1>The enemy.</h1>
                <p>Please help us kill the jellyfish. We will feed their parts to sharks.
                    We need sharks, they are so vital to marine life. $0.01 bounty for each
                    jellyfish! We need this. Without your help, it could be the very end of
                    our world. These jellyfish are going to fill the oceans with themselves.
                    What's worse is that they don't give back! So that's why there is a $0.001
                    bounty for each jellyfish killed! We won't stop until we rid the oceans with
                    this scourge of the world. And that's why we have set up a $0.0001 bounty for
                    each and every jellyfish, because we care about the environment that we're willing
                    to give $0.00001 to those who help. Thank you. <br> - US Senate Krakinski Arkansaw
